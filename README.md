[SpinKit](http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/)
============

Simple spinners animated with CSS. See [demo](http://tobiasahlin.com/spinkit/).

SpinKit uses CSS animations [in browsers that supports them](http://caniuse.com/css-animation) to create smooth and easily customizable animations. The goal is not to offer a solution that works in every browser. If you're building a site with users running IE9 and below, you'll want to detect support for the `animation` attribute, and create a fallback, e.g. by replacing the spinner with a GIF.

## Contribution

If you're submitting a new animation, make sure that it looks identical in [all browsers that has support for CSS animations](http://caniuse.com/css-animation).
